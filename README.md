# AI-and-cognitive-systems
This repository contains a few projects that solve generic challenges of artificial intelligence and cognitive systems using Java. Every module contains some gradle tests to validate the solutions.

### Module1 - Neural Networks
Learning the XOR logic function using the forward propagation algorithm for neural networks.

### Module2 - Optimization, Genetic Algorithm and Basic Planning
The challenges used for the opmitimization and genetic algorithms were inspired by google AI challenges:
https://developers.google.com/optimization/routing

One of the choosen problems is to assign each worker to one task at most (two workers can't be performing the same task) while minimizing the total cost.

### Module3 - Autonomous Agent using Reactive, Adaptive and Deliberative layers
It is intended to realize an agent capable of navigating in a space with obstacles and a target to collect. The agent movement is continuous or discrete depending on the challenge. The first image shows a reactive agent (continuous movement), while the second one shows an adaptive agent (discrete movement). The deliberative layer uses both adaptive and reactive layer. The results obtained for the deliberative implementation weren't as good as the other ones.
