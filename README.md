# AI-and-cognitive-systems
This repository has small projects solving generic challenges of artificial intelligence and cognitive systems using Java. Most of the logic was made during the 1st semester of my MSc Degree, the goal is now to improve the implementations previously made.

Every module has some gradle tests to validate the implementation.

### Module1- Neural Networks
### Module2- Optimization, Genetic Algorithm and Basic Planning
The challenges used for the opmitimization and genetic algorithms were inspired by google AI challenges:

### Module3- Autonomous Agent using Reactive, Adaptive and Deliberative layers
