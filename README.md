# AI & Cognitive Systems
This repository contains a few projects that solve generic challenges of artificial intelligence and cognitive systems using **Java**. Every module contains some _Gradle_ tests that validate the respective solution.

## Module 1 - _Neural Networks_
Learning the XOR logic function using the _Forward Propagation_ algorithm for neural networks.

## Module 2 - _Optimization & Genetic algorithms_
Some of the challenges included in this module were inspired by Google's OR-Tools problems:
- [**Traveling Salesperson**](https://developers.google.com/optimization/routing/tsp)
- [**Assignment with Teams of Workers**](https://developers.google.com/optimization/assignment/assignment_teams)

Illustrated below, is the _Assignment with Teams of Workers_ problem, where the goal was to assign every worker to a single task while trying to minimize the total cost as much as possible. Two workers can't be performing the same task.

## Module 3 - _Autonomous Agent using Reactive, Adaptive and Deliberative layers_
The purpose of this module was to create an agent capable of navigating in a space of obstacles and a target to collect. The agent movement is _continuous_ or _discrete_, depending on the challenge. The first image shows a reactive agent (continuous movement), while the second image shows an adaptive agent (discrete movement). The deliberative layer uses both the adaptive and reactive layer. The results obtained for the deliberative implementation weren't as good as the other two layers.
